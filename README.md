Fijo is ideal for career development and allows jobseekers to post their CV‚Äôs and employers to post jobs.<br><br>If we consider the app from the perspective of the candidate then the candidate can compose his resume and can edit it. The candidate has the opportunity to view all available companies and vacancies and apply for an open vacancy. If we consider the app from the side of the company then the company can publish its open vacancies view the resumes of already registered candidates and see all the applications that came from candidates in its personal dashboard.</p>
